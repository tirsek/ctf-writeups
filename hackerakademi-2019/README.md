### Acknowledgements

I would like to say thank you to FE-DDIS for all the hard work they must have
put into building these challenges. Even though this is not the first time
we've encountered the Femtium architecture, it looks like it has come a long
way over the past couple of years, and so has the software written for it.
Seeing a whole Unix'y kernel implementation on it as well as a cross-compiling
toolchain is amazing. I am in awe of your dedication to this, and thrilled to
have been a part of this CTF. I had so much fun with it, and I hope we haven't
seen the last of Femtium and Fenix!
