# Dumpster Dive

We're given a PDF, which when opened in a normal PDF viewer simply says
"I attached/embedded some source code found in the trash...". The PDF
file actually contains a nested PDF file with a tiny bit of javascript
source code as well as another PDF file. This nested structure is
almost 500 levels deep.

First I tried a recursive binwalk of the PDF to extract the data
embedded within, but that turned out to be incredibly resource
intensive. Instead, I switched to a much more lightweight solution
using `pdfdetach` from [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) in a
bash one-liner (here broken up for readability):

```sh
i=1; file=dumpster_dive.pdf; while true; do
	next=$(printf "%03d.pdf" $i); echo $next; i=$[$i+1];
	pdfdetach -save 1 -o $next $file || break; file=$next;
done
```

This unpacks the nested structure into 490 new PDF files. The last
attachment saved as 491.pdf is actually a plain javascript file
containing a copy of the jQuery library. We'll rename that one to
`jquery.js`.

```sh
mv 491.pdf jquery.js
```

When opening some of the remaining PDF files in the normal PDF viewer,
each file contains a header saying, for example, "387 of 490" in
001.pdf, as well as a line of program code. We'll have to extract these
lines, and put them back in the correct order, in order to recover the
program.

I tried to do that using `pdftotext`, also from Poppler, but it turns
out that pdftotext is not good at maintaining the number of spaces
embedded in the PDF text, and that turns out to be important for the
end result.

Instead, I ended up extracting the first zlib-compressed stream from
each PDF using a simple `awk` script, decompressing it with `zpipe`,
and picking out the sequence number and associated program code with
`sed`, rearranging the pieces back in order using `sort`, and finally
discarding the sort key, all in another beautiful bash one-liner, again
broken up for readability:

```sh
for a in ???.pdf; do
	awk '/^endstream/{exit} ok{print} /^stream$/{ok=1}' $a | zpipe -d |
	sed 's/^.* Td (\([0-9]*\) of 490).* Td (\(.*\))Tj ET *$/\1\t\2\n/; s/\\\([\\()]\)/\1/g'
done | tee /dev/stderr | sort -n | cut -f2 > dumpster_dive_assembled.html
```

The final [dumpster_dive_assembled.html](dumpster_dive_assembled.html)
file can then be opened in a browser, and the javascript code will
spell out the flag in amazingly 1990s ASCII art.
